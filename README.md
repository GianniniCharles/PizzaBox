# PizzaBox

Before we get started, a  story! I chatted with a friend regarding a time when a pizza delivery driver was desperately trying to sell a pizza from a delivery that didn't go through. We talked and thought it would be awesome for any pizza place like that to have an easy way to make a little profit off those pizzas.


PizzaBox is an app that aims to enable pizza restaurants to quickly sell off "dead" pizzas when all else fails.

"Dead" refers to a term in the food service industry where a food order made does not reach the intended customer for whatever reason (cancelled, rejected the food, couldn't find them, etc).



## How to use Pizzabox

- Click on the register link to go to the register page.
- Here, you can choose a username /password, and what type of user you will be:
        -If you want to sell pizzaboxes, you should register as a restaurant.
        -If you just want to see and buy pizzaboxes, you should register as a customer.
- Click the submit button to go back to the login page.
- Type in your username and password to sign in.
Don't worry! Your password is encrypted and salted to keep your information safe.

## Navigation in general

There is a nav bar at the bottom that says "home", "pizzaboxes", and "my account". 
These will take you to the main areas of this app.


-Home:
- Takes restaurant users to the restaurant page.
- Takes customers right to the pizzaboxes page. After all, what else are you on here for? ;)


Pizzaboxes:
- You can click here to see all active pizzaboxes in the system. You can click on them to attempt a purchase*.
- *The purchase feature will not actually be available until future development occurs to comply with local, state, and federal laws regarding consumer privacy and safety in the USA.
-If you click "Buy this PizzaBox", you'll get a funny message.

My Account: 
- You will see your username, password, and usertype. The logout button is here.

## Creating PizzaBoxes: Restaurants ONLY
- From home, restaurant users will have the option to create a pizzabox or see ONLY their own pizzaboxes.
- If you click on "See My Pizzaboxes", you'll be directed to the screen where you see each pizzabox.
- From here you have the option to add, delete, or edit a pizza box.
- WARNING! If you click delete, it will instantly DELETE IT.


##Adding/Editing a Pizzabox: Restaurants ONLY

- The pizzabox at the moment takes four pieces of data from you to either add or edit.
- 1. The name of the store you got the pizza from. Brands make a difference, and helps people tell which is which :)
- 2. Pizza name. What is the name of the pizza?
- 3. Price. Enter a number in USD ($). No decimals, letters, or symbols, please. Just numbers :)
- 4. Description: Write any details you'd like to write about the pizza.

Once you have that information, it will appear on the screen!
